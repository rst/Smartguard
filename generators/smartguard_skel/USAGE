This generator installs basic Role, RoleAssignment and 
Permission models as required by Smartguard, along with
migrations to create them.  You may wish to add an access
control to these models themselves.  (Then again, you may
wish that the author of the generator had provided one as
an option; that's coming soon.)

This generator also installs a unit test which simply 
assures that Smartguard's require models are present and
correctly wired up.

The generator DOES NOT INSTALL a User model.  Smartguard
requires one nonetheless, but it doesn't require much of 
it.  No particular fields are required; just come up with
a User class that meets your requirements (the one from
the restful_authentication plugin should work fine), and
add the line

  include SmartguardBasicUser

as the first line of the class definition (that is,
immediately after 'class User < ActiveRecord::Base').
The unit test installed by the generator will make sure
that you've done this correctly.
